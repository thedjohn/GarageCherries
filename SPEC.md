# GarageCherries — Master Specification

> Generated 2026-07-02 from a full read of every route, page, and library file. Last updated 2026-07-22 (dealer data-feed sync built end-to-end. New `dealer_locations` table + `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/dealer/locations` let a dealer with more than one physical showroom (e.g. Survivor Classic Car Services — Tampa/Chicago/Atlanta) manage each one from Settings; marking a location primary mirrors it onto the dealer's own row so every existing page reading those fields keeps working unchanged, and a dealer's public page shows an "Our Locations" section once 2+ exist. New `app/api/cron/dealer-feed-sync/route.ts` fetches a dealer's CSV inventory feed and three-way syncs it (insert/update/mark-sold, matched by VIN falling back to a new `stock_number` column), parsing per-row location data for vendors whose feed encodes it as a "City, State" label rather than real City/State columns, capping images at 30 evenly sampled across the full set, and flagging (not dropping) any make not yet in `MAKES`. Self-service added the same day: dealers configure their own `feed_url` and a `feed_sync_hour` (UTC) from a new Feed Sync settings section, and a "Sync now" button (`POST /api/dealer/feed-sync`) runs an immediate one-off sync sharing the exact same code the daily cron uses — the cron itself moved from a single hardcoded daily entry to running hourly and querying `dealers` for whichever ones' `feed_sync_hour` matches the current hour, so each dealer still gets one automatic sync/day but at a time they choose (required upgrading from Vercel's Hobby to Pro plan, which only allows once-daily cron on Hobby). Also fixed a real bug found while wiring this up: `is_feed_managed` (added 2026-07-02 as forward-compat for this exact feature) was never actually being set by the sync — now set true on both insert and update, so feed-managed listings correctly skip the manual renewal flow and expiring-listings reminder email as originally designed. See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for full detail).
> Prior update 2026-07-21 (three new Car Guide route categories added — `/cars/[bodyStyle]` (convertibles, coupes, pickup-trucks, fastbacks), `/cars/[decade]` (1930s–2010s), `/cars/[priceTier]` (under-10k through 50k-plus) — plus real bug fixes to dealer password reset, Google Merchant Listings schema, and admin panel phone/URL display. See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for full detail).
> Prior update 2026-07-19 (live SEO audit of garagecherries.com found and fixed a real broken page: `/reports` was showing 0 active listings / blank pricing / "No data yet" charts despite 14 real live listings, because its query selected `listings.views` — a column that doesn't exist on the table — and the code never checked for the resulting query error, silently zeroing out every stat on the page; fixed to read real view counts from `listing_views` instead (the same dead-column issue already fixed in the dealer digest email back on 2026-07-14, but never applied here), scoped to the current month to match the section's "This Month" heading. Also fixed a content-honesty gap: an unearned "thousands of listings" claim (real inventory is 14 cars) had already been removed from the homepage's visible hero text on 2026-07-13, but was missed in the site-wide default meta description/OG description (`app/layout.tsx`) and 3 other pages' visible copy (`/listings`, `/about`, `/guides`) — all 4 reworded to drop the inflated count, replacing USA-only framing with "worldwide" to match the rest of the site. Also fixed a dealer page meta description (`app/dealers/[slug]/page.tsx`) that truncated mid-word with no word-boundary awareness — added a small `truncateAtWord()` helper. See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for full verification detail).
> Prior update 2026-07-18 (dealer website directory links fixed — `/dealers` card links were styled to look clickable but had no real `href` (a plain `<p>` showing the URL as text), nested inside a card-wide internal `Link`; fixed via a new small Client Component (`components/DealerWebsiteLink.tsx`) rendered from the Server Component page, since an `onClick`/`stopPropagation` handler can't live directly on a Server Component element. Duplicate "Dealers" header label fixed — desktop nav had both a nav item and a near-identical Sign In link both effectively reading "Dealers"; relabeled to "Dealer Sign In" to match the mobile menu's existing wording. Then a 3-part sitemap/routing hardening pass, all found via live validation against the DB rather than assumption: (1) a listing approved ~2 hours earlier was still confirmed missing from `/sitemap.xml` despite the 300s revalidate window — the passive window only refreshes on the next request after going stale, so with no traffic hitting it right then it can lag indefinitely; added `revalidatePath('/sitemap.xml')` in `app/api/admin/listings/route.ts` right after a listing's status flips to `approved`, same pattern already used for `/events`; (2) a private-seller listing's model was typo'd "Cutless" instead of "Cutlass" in `title`/`model`/`slug` (description already said "Cutlass" throughout, confirming a data-entry slip) — corrected directly in the DB plus a permanent redirect from the old URL, same pattern as the earlier AutoArcheologist dealer-slug fix; (3) `/listings/[make]/[model]` was 404ing for 13 of 14 live listings — `modelFromSegment()` (`lib/data.ts`) resolved the URL's model segment against the tiny hardcoded `CARS` mock array instead of live inventory, so only "Plymouth Barracuda" worked by accident; fixed both the page and its `generateMetadata` to resolve the canonical model name from a live DB query first, mirroring the live-DB pattern the file's own 1-segment make-page section already used — verified locally that previously-404ing pages now render correctly and the one already-working page is unaffected. Finally, added a new daily Vercel Cron job (`GET /api/cron/sitemap-health`, alongside the existing `promo-expiry`/`expiring-listings`) that automates exactly these two failure modes going forward: completeness (every live listing's detail URL must appear in the sitemap) and reachability (every sitemap URL must actually resolve) — silent when healthy, emails the admin with specifics via the existing `notifyAdmin()` helper when something's wrong. Also this session: 3 makes added (Fiberfab, Lotus, MG) after a live comparison against a competitor site's make list. See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for full per-item detail and verification notes).
> Prior update 2026-07-17 (large session covering: (1) fixed 9 more instances of the doubled page-title bug from 2026-07-12 — `app/layout.tsx`'s `%s | GarageCherries` template plus a redundant manual suffix, this time on `/cars/[make]`, `/about`, `/account/alerts`, `/account/watchlist`, `/advertise`, `/events/[slug]` (both the normal title and "Not Found" fallback), `/reports`, `/sold`; (2) encyclopedia expanded 77 → 99 models, 12 → 20 makes — added BMW, Mazda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Nissan, Volkswagen, International, Mercedes (2–4 models each), plus a new non-model "brand overview" page type at `/cars/srt` covering Dodge's SRT performance sub-brand across its full history, linked from `/cars` and `/cars/dodge` specifically; (3) `app/sitemap.ts` fixed — listings query had no status filter (rejected listings produced dead 404s, pending ones leaked unreviewed content into search), and `revalidate` cut from 3600s to 300s after finding live that 6 of 8 real listings were unreachable via the sitemap immediately after creation; (4) homepage hero Year Min/Max converted from unbounded number inputs to dropdowns scoped to actual inventory (matching an earlier fix already applied to the `/listings` sidebar); (5) `fetchCars()` (`lib/db.ts`) model filter changed from an exact match to an `ilike` prefix match on the model family's first word — real listing titles are almost always more specific than a Car Guide entry's general model name (e.g. "Challenger SRT Hellcat" vs. "Challenger"), so exact matching silently showed "No listings currently available" on nearly every Car Guide page; (6) dealer AutoArcheologist's slug (`david-brill`, generated from his original application's personal name) updated to `autoarcheologist` to match his current display name, with a permanent redirect from the old URL — validated first that listings reference dealers by permanent ID, not slug, so none of his 6 listings were affected; (7) `listings.seller_name`/`seller_phone` (a one-time snapshot taken at listing creation, never updated again) were showing stale dealer names/phones on the admin Listings tab after a dealer renamed their business — same root cause as (6), same live-override fix already used on the public listing detail page now also applied to `GET /api/admin/listings`; (8) new `listings.fb_posted_at` column plus a manual "Post to Facebook"/"Repost to Facebook" admin action, built after investigating why 1 of 6 dealer-added listings never auto-posted to the Facebook Page — credentials, Vercel env config, and image data all checked out clean, root cause was never conclusively identified (likely a one-off transient failure that never threw, so nothing was logged), resolved operationally rather than by further root-causing a non-reproducible glitch; both existing auto-post trigger points now stamp `fb_posted_at` on success too, and reposting an already-posted listing requires an explicit confirm to avoid accidental duplicate Facebook posts; (9) admin Listings tab gained per-listing view/watcher counts (new admin-gated `GET /api/admin/watcher-counts`, mirrors the existing dealer-facing one but without the ownership restriction) and full filtering/sorting/pagination — default sort changed from newest-submitted-first to Year (newest) → Make → Model; filters for make, model, year/price range, status, resubmissions-only, featured-only, dealer-vs-private-seller (resolved via a `dealers` table lookup since there's no boolean column for this), and Facebook posted/not-posted; real pagination (20/page) matching the existing Users tab pattern; the "X pending · Y approved · Z rejected" summary moved server-side as three independent unfiltered counts so it can't go wrong once results are paginated/filtered, with optimistic client-side adjustments after approve/reject/edit/delete; (10) fixed a broken E2E test (`buyer-golden-path.spec.ts`, "body style filter applies correctly") that had been failing on every CI run all session — a hardcoded `select.nth(1)` index broke when an earlier commit added a second Year dropdown and shifted every subsequent select's position; the actual site feature was never broken, only the test's selector. Full CI (`check` + `e2e`) green on every push from this fix onward. See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for the complete per-item detail and verification notes on all of the above).
> Prior update 2026-07-14 (finished the `inquiries` cleanup from the prior entry below by deleting the table, `app/api/inquire/route.ts`, and its dead cascade-delete reference in `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` — that reference had been silently broken regardless, filtering on a `user_id` column `inquiries` never had. Requires `supabase/migrations/20260714_drop_inquiries.sql` to be run manually — no FK references point at the table).
> Prior update 2026-07-14 (rewired three dealer-facing features off the orphaned `inquiries` table — `POST /api/inquire` has had no live caller since "Message Seller" moved to `conversations`/`messages`. `GET /api/dealer/metrics` and `POST /api/email/dealer-report` now read `conversations` instead, scoped by `listing_id IN (dealer's listing ids)` since `conversations` has no `dealer_id` column — same pattern `GET /api/conversations` already uses. Also fixed a second, independent dead-data bug in the dealer digest email: "Top Listings by Views" read a never-incremented `listings.views` column instead of the working `listing_views` table. Live-verified by inserting a real test conversation+message and confirming it appeared correctly in the dealer dashboard's Overview stat, "Recent inquiries" panel, and Inquiries tab, then deleting the test rows — see §4 `dealer/metrics`, `inquire`, and `email/dealer-report` entries).
> Prior update 2026-07-14 (VIN moved above Year/Make/Model on `/sell` (`app/sell/SellClient.tsx`) so a clean NHTSA decode auto-fills any of those three still blank — never overwrites a field the user already typed, and Make is matched case-insensitively against `MAKES` since NHTSA returns e.g. "CHRYSLER" against the dropdown's "Chrysler". Fixed a real bug this reorder would have surfaced: `POST /api/cars/verify-vin`'s match logic requires at least one of make/model/year to explicitly agree before reporting `verified: true`, so checking a VIN before any field had content always fell through to "Partial Match" even for a clean decode — fixed client-side by detecting all three match fields `null` (nothing provided, as opposed to `false` — explicitly disagrees) and showing a distinct "VIN Decoded" message instead; the API route itself is unchanged, since it already returned the right signal, just nothing on the client was distinguishing it. Live-verified with VIN `3C3AY75S75T283365` — see §6 for the endpoint's null-vs-false semantics).
> Prior update 2026-07-14 (dealer public profile (`app/dealers/[slug]/page.tsx`) and dashboard Overview "Your listings" panel now both filter `is_sold=false`, matching the homepage/`/listings`/`fetchCars()` pattern — "Mark as Sold" only sets `is_sold`, never changes `status`, so both surfaces kept showing sold cars as available inventory before this fix; the dashboard Inventory tab and private-seller "My Listings" section are unaffected — both intentionally still show sold listings with a status badge. Also added a "Sign out" link to `components/AccountTabBar.tsx`, shared by `/account` and `/messages` — previously no way to sign out from either page except clearing cookies manually).
> Prior update 2026-07-13 (per-listing views and watcher counts now shown to both dealers and private sellers — `GET /api/dealer/watcher-counts` gained `views` and `totalWatchers` response fields alongside the pre-existing `counts`/`messaged`; displayed on the dealer dashboard's Overview "Your listings" panel, the Inventory tab table, and the private-seller account page's My Listings cards — see §4 `watcher-counts` for the full response shape. Also fixed a real bug found while manually verifying the dealer Add Vehicle flow live: `app/dealer/dashboard/page.tsx`'s `loadData()` only handled the case where a `dealers` row was found via `.single()`; an authenticated user with no matching row (e.g. a superadmin with no dealer profile) got a silently broken dashboard — `dealer` state stayed `null` forever while a fallback display name masked the problem, so every dealer-data-dependent action was a silent no-op. Now redirects to `/dealer/login?error=no_dealer_account`).
> Prior update 2026-07-13 (250th promo extended from July 31 to "end of year" — `DEFAULT_SITE_SETTINGS.promoApplicationCutoff`/`promoExpiresAt` in `lib/siteSettings.ts` both now default to `2026-12-31`; new OG image/promo graphic at the same file paths; "US" → "USA" and "Nationwide" → "Worldwide" sitewide; homepage hero subtext reworded to drop an unearned "thousands of listings" claim and USA-only framing. Advertiser signups now follow the same promo-window pattern as dealer signups — before `promoApplicationCutoff`, `trial_ends_at = promoExpiresAt` instead of `now + advertiserTrialDays`; signup/pricing copy shows "Free through [date]" during the window. Vehicle listing fields unified across `/sell`, the dealer Add/Edit Vehicle modal, and the admin Edit Listing modal into one shared `components/VehicleFieldsForm.tsx` — required fields are now consistently Year/Make/Model/Condition/Body Style/Fuel Type/Transmission/Drive Type/Price/Description/≥1 photo, Mileage/City/State optional everywhere (dealer City/State pre-fill from the dealer's account on Add), VIN now shown on all three forms; `/api/listings/submit` validates `transmission`/`driveType` server-side; required a migration adding `p_drive_type` to `insert_listing_with_limit` — see §3, §4, §5). Also fixed: the live `site_settings` DB row still had the old `2026-08-01`/`2026-10-31` dates even after the code-level defaults were updated (code only falls back to defaults when the row is missing) — updated directly via SQL; and `handle_new_user_profile()`, a DB trigger that seeds `profiles.promo_expires_at` for email/password signups, had its own independent hardcoded `2026-10-31` literal separate from `app/auth/callback/route.ts`'s (OAuth signups) — found via a live `pg_get_functiondef` introspection query and fixed with a second migration. Also: dealer-deletion now resets any stuck `dealer_applications` row instead of leaving it permanently `status='approved'` with a null `dealer_id`; 3 silently-broken `api.admin.users.test.ts` tests fixed (mock never gained an `update()` stub for that fix).
> Prior update 2026-07-11 (configurable free-account durations added: new `site_settings` table + `GET/PATCH /api/admin/settings` route let a superadmin adjust the 250th-promo cutoff dates and the default advertiser/dealer trial lengths from `/admin` → Team tab, replacing four previously-hardcoded literals across `admin/dealer-applications`, `advertiser/signup`, `cron/promo-expiry`, and `email/promo-expiry`, all falling back to the original hardcoded values if the settings row is ever missing; a separate per-account override was also added to the existing Users tab Edit modal, letting any admin-role team member hand-adjust a specific dealer's `beta_expires_at` or advertiser's `trial_ends_at` independent of the global defaults — see §3 `site_settings`, §4 `admin/settings` and updated `admin/users` entries, and §5 for the updated business rules).
> Prior update 2026-07-10, commit `c5aa783` (unit test coverage expanded from 8.67% to 99.19% statements / 90.61% branches / 96.26% functions / 99.78% lines across every API route and lib file — 831 tests across 49 files, up from 312/21; fixed a fake-coverage bug in `lib/matchAlerts.ts` where `scoreMatch`/`alertName`/`matchBadges` weren't exported and existing tests exercised local reimplementations instead of the real code, now exported and tested directly along with the full `matchAndNotifyAlerts` orchestrator; added coverage thresholds — 97/88/94/97 — to `vitest.config.ts` and switched CI to `npm run test:coverage` so coverage can't silently regress undetected again).
> Prior update 2026-07-10, commit `98fc3c8` (buyer signup Full Name bug fixed — name field is now required, is passed into `auth.signUp()`'s `options.data` so it lands in Supabase Auth `user_metadata` immediately, and a `handle_new_user_profile()` trigger on `auth.users` insert now writes it to `profiles.full_name` server-side, replacing a client-side upsert that silently failed under RLS because it ran before the user had a session — this project requires email confirmation, so `auth.signUp()` returns no session until the confirmation link is clicked; trigger is scoped to `provider='email'` so it doesn't race the existing Google/Facebook profile-seeding + promo logic in `/auth/callback`; Supabase Auth Redirect URLs allow-list fixed — was missing `/account/reset-password` and `/dealer/login`, causing password-reset emails to silently fall back to the bare homepage instead of the reset form, fixed via `https://garagecherries.com/**` + `https://www.garagecherries.com/**` wildcard entries, dashboard-only change).
> Prior update 2026-07-09 (Sign in with Google added and published to production; Sign in with Facebook added — working for app Admins/Testers, blocked from public use pending Meta Business Verification for GARAGE CHERRIES LLC; GarageCherries Facebook Page created and linked to its Business Portfolio; Facebook Page auto-posting code built for dealer listings, admin events, and listing/event approval flows — inert until Page access token is configured; site OG image swapped to a static 250th-anniversary promo graphic (`app/opengraph-image.jpg`, replacing the old dynamic `opengraph-image.tsx`) — this broke link previews in production same-day (layout.tsx metadata pointed at the old extensionless path) and was fixed same day; Detail 360 sponsor card + Lemon Squad inspection card removed from listing detail sidebar (accidentally restored earlier the same day; neither is a real live partner); GitHub Actions CI fixed — had been silently failing all day on a pre-existing `NextRequest` type mismatch in a test file, auto-bypassed by branch protection; seller emailed on first buyer message — `POST /api/conversations` fires Resend on new conversation only; sold listing UI hardened on both account page and dealer dashboard — Edit button, expiry text, Mark Sold/Renew all hidden when is_sold; dealer inventory export adds seat_material + seating_type; WatchlistButton/Verified/Mark Sold tooltips removed; tooltip align/side props; shared emailBranding helper + all emails rebranded; rejection email log.flush fix; expiring-listings Vercel Cron; conversation list buyer_id fix; MessengerWidget sender_name server-side; Warn User feedback banner with Dismiss; reported message full-thread view with Warn/Suspend actions; E2E suite updated + events spec added; community event submission + approval workflow; sitemap expanded to all pages; Axiom logging expanded to all high-value API routes; events calendar + admin Events tab; dealer watcher messaging UI; BETA_MODE documented; promo campaign, homepage hero copy, GA4, Vercel redeploy, custom domain, promo expiry enforcement, pricing page advertiser section, advertiser public pages, sitemap expansion, SEO structured data, GSC + Bing verified; Sentry error tracking + Axiom structured logging added; sell form contact section removed — seller identity sourced from profiles table; sticky sidebar/AdSlot overlap fixed; persistent "Post a Listing" button added to My Listings; client-side image resize + gallery photo preloading; Ram added to MAKES + dropdowns alphabetized + shared TRANSMISSIONS constant; sold listings excluded from homepage/`/listings`/`fetchCars`; SessionGuard added for forced logout on deleted/invalid accounts — commit `f098067`; CAPTCHA + rate limiting (3/hr/IP) added to `/api/advertiser/signup`; Turnstile CAPTCHA added to `/account/signup` (client-side guard); unit test suite expanded to 294 tests across 19 files — emailBranding, encyclopedia, adminRole, verifyTurnstile, notifyAdmin, logger coverage added; SPEC.md security table updated for advertiser signup rate limit; encyclopedia expanded 54 → 77 models — 23 new entries across AMC/Buick/Chevrolet/Chrysler/Ford/Mercury/Oldsmobile/Plymouth/Pontiac; Dodge Dart GT added to notable versions).

## 2. User Flows

### 2.1 New User Browsing and Buying

1. Land on homepage (`/`) — sees featured listings, value props, search widget.
2. Browse `/listings` — filter by make, model, year range, price, condition, body style, transmission, state.
3. Navigate `cars/[make]` or `cars/[make]/[model]` to browse by make/model.
4. Click a listing → `/listings/[make]/[model]/[id]/[slug]`.
5. Listing detail page fires `POST /api/track-view` (hashed IP deduplication per listing per day).
6. Buyer sees a "Message Seller" form (`components/ContactSellerForm.tsx`) — guests are redirected to `/account/login?return=/listings` first; login is required.
7. `POST /api/conversations` → creates (or finds an existing) conversation for this buyer+listing, inserts the first `messages` row, emails the seller on first contact only (reply-to the buyer). Visible to the buyer afterward under `/account`'s Messages tab. (`POST /api/inquire`, a separate one-way contact-form path, was deleted 2026-07-14 — it had no live caller.)
8. To make an offer, user submits `POST /api/offers` (auth optional) → emails dealer + buyer confirmation.
9. To watchlist, user must be logged in → `POST /api/watchlist` toggles watch; sets `allow_dealer_contact = true` by default.
10. Authenticated user can create a saved search alert from the filters on `/listings` — up to 10 per account.
11. When a matching new listing is approved, system emails the user with match details.
12. User can manage watchlist and alerts at `/account` (tabs: Watchlist, Messages, Alerts, Listings, Settings).

### 2.2 Private Seller Posting a Listing

1. Navigate to `/sell`.
2. If not logged in, `SellGate` component shown — redirects to `/account/signup?return=/sell` or `/account/login?return=/sell`.
3. Authenticated user sees `SellClient` (`app/sell/SellClient.tsx` — `SellForm.tsx`, dead code never imported, was deleted 2026-07-14):
   a0. VIN field is first, above the rest of Vehicle Information (moved 2026-07-14). Optionally enters VIN and clicks "Verify VIN" — calls `POST /api/cars/verify-vin` inline. On a clean decode, Year/Make/Model are auto-filled if still blank (never overwrites a field already typed into); result shown as a color-coded message (green=verified, blue="VIN Decoded"=clean decode with nothing yet to compare, blue=pre-1981, yellow=partial mismatch, red=invalid). VIN and verification status stored with listing on submit.
   a. Fills vehicle info via the shared `VehicleFieldsForm` component (`components/VehicleFieldsForm.tsx`, also used by the dealer and admin forms as of 2026-07-13): required — year (1900–2030), make (dropdown), model, condition, body style, fuel type, transmission, drive type, price, description; optional — mileage, engine, color.
   b. Fills location: city (optional, as of 2026-07-13), state (optional as of 2026-07-13; if provided, still validated against US state codes).
   c. ~~Contact section removed (2026-07-06)~~ — seller name, phone, and email are no longer collected on the form. Because `/sell` requires login, the API reads seller identity from the authenticated session and the `profiles` table (`full_name`, `phone`); falls back to the auth email if `full_name` is not yet set.
   d. Uploads photos (up to 30): clicks "Add photos" → files stored as `File` objects in component state with local `URL.createObjectURL()` previews — nothing uploaded yet. Upload happens on submit (see step 4).
4. On submit, images are uploaded first — directly from the browser to Supabase Storage (`listing-images` bucket, `cars/private/` path) using the Supabase JS client. Public URLs are collected, then `POST /api/listings/submit` (multipart) is sent with all fields + `imageUrls` JSON array. The API looks up `seller_name` and `seller_phone` from `profiles`; `seller_email` is taken from `user.email`. The `POST /api/listings/upload-image` signed-URL route exists but is not used by this form.
5. API checks: rate limit (5/hour/IP), Turnstile CAPTCHA, listing limit (10 active if not dealer, unless `BETA_MODE=true`), beta expiry for dealers.
6. Listing inserted with `status: 'pending'`, `featured: false`.
7. Seller sees "Listing Submitted" confirmation screen.
8. Admin reviews listing at `/admin` (Listings tab).
9. On approval: `listed_at` set to now, seller emailed "Your listing is live", alert matching triggered via `POST /api/alerts/match`.
10. On rejection: `rejection_reason` stored, seller emailed "Your listing needs attention" with reason.
11. Seller can edit listing at `/account?tab=listings`: editable fields are year, make, model, body style, condition, fuel type, engine, transmission, exterior color, interior color, seat material, city, state, price, mileage, description, and photos (drag-to-reorder). Seller name/phone/email are not editable per-listing — managed in Settings. Editing an approved listing sends it back to pending. Editing a rejected listing requires `resubmission_note`.

### 2.3 Dealer Applying and Managing Inventory

1. Navigate to `/dealer/apply` — fills application form (name, email, phone, dealer name, address, city, state, zip, website, specialties, description) + Turnstile.
2. `POST /api/dealer/apply` — rate limit 3/hour/IP; checks for duplicate pending/approved application or existing dealer; inserts into `dealer_applications`.
3. Admin reviews at `/admin` (Applications tab) — only admin/superadmin can approve/reject.
4. On approval:
   - Auth user created (email confirmed, no password).
   - Dealer row inserted with `plan: 'beta'`; `beta_expires_at` = the configured `promo_expires_at` (default `2026-12-31`) for applications submitted before the configured `promo_application_cutoff` (default `2026-12-31`, 250th promo period), otherwise `now + dealer_default_trial_days`.
   - Password reset link generated and emailed to dealer.
5. Dealer sets password via link, logs into `/dealer/dashboard`.
6. Dashboard tabs: Overview (stats), Inventory, Inquiries, Settings.
7. **Add inventory**: clicks "+ Add vehicle" → `VehicleModal` with rich fields (year, make, model, mileage, condition, body style, engine details, HP, torque, cylinders, displacement, forced induction, fuel type, transmission, speeds, drive type, exterior/interior color, seat material, seating type, VIN, price, description, photos). Core spec fields (year/make/model/mileage/condition/body style/fuel type/engine/transmission/drive type/color/price/description) now come from a shared `components/VehicleFieldsForm.tsx`, also used by `/sell` and the admin Edit Listing modal (added 2026-07-13); dealer-only extras (HP, torque, cylinders, displacement, forced induction, speeds, interior color, seat material, seating type) remain inline in `VehicleModal`. Required: year, make, model, condition, body style, fuel type, transmission, drive type, price, description, ≥1 photo. City/State/mileage optional; City/State pre-fill from the dealer's account on Add. Dealer listings bypass review — inserted with `status: 'approved'` immediately.
8. **Edit inventory**: same modal, pre-filled. If price drops, `price_history` row inserted + `POST /api/notify-watchers` fired.
9. **Delete inventory**: `DELETE /api/listings/[id]` — removes images from storage, deletes conversations.
10. **Mark sold**: `POST /api/cars/sold` — sets `is_sold: true`, notifies watchlist users.
11. **Message watchers**: dealer sends message to opted-in watchers via `POST /api/dealer/message-watchers` — one-time per watcher, email sent, `dealer_messaged_at` recorded.
12. **Update profile**: `POST /api/dealer/settings` — updates `dealers` table fields (name, phone, address, location, state, zip, description, website, specialties).
13. **Export inventory**: clicks "Export CSV" or "Export JSON" → `GET /api/dealer/export?format=csv|json` → triggers authenticated download of all dealer listings.
13. **Metrics**: `GET /api/dealer/metrics` returns views (30d + delta), inquiries (30d + delta), avg days on market, recent inquiries.
14. Beta expiry warning shown at ≤30 days remaining.

### 2.4 Advertiser Signing Up and Creating an Ad

1. Navigate to `/advertise` page (public marketing page) or `/advertiser/signup`.
2. `POST /api/advertiser/signup` — creates Supabase auth user + `advertisers` row with 14-day trial, chosen tier (starter/metro/regional/statewide), radius_miles derived from tier.
3. Login at `/advertiser/login`.
4. Access dashboard at `/advertiser/dashboard`.
5. Create ad via `POST /api/advertiser/ads` with headline, body copy, CTA label/URL, phone, logo URL, photo URL, rating, review count.
6. If trial expired, ad creation blocked with `TRIAL_EXPIRED` error.
7. `GET /api/ads/serve?state=XX` picks a random eligible advertiser whose trial is valid and whose tier covers that state → returns ad with least impressions from their active ads.
8. Every serve logs an `ad_events` impression row + increments `ads.impressions` via RPC.
9. Click events: `POST /api/ads/track` → logs `ad_events` click row + increments `ads.clicks` via RPC.
10. Advertiser can edit/delete ads via `POST/DELETE /api/advertiser/ads`.

### 2.5 Admin Moderating Content

1. Admin navigates to `/admin` — access gated by `admin_users` row.
2. **Role resolved first** — before any data loads, the page calls `GET /api/admin/team` to read the acting user's role.
3. **Support role scoping** (fixed 2026-07-02): support users are redirected to the Reported tab automatically; only reported content is loaded. They see only the Reported tab; Listings and Users tabs are hidden from the nav. Attempting to access those tabs directly would still require moderator+ at the API layer.
4. **Listings tab** (moderator+): sees all listings with pending/approved/rejected counts. Can approve, reject (with reason from preset list or custom), edit (admin+), delete (superadmin only). Hidden from support.
5. **Messages tab** (moderator+): views all conversations (buyer/seller/listing title/timestamp). Hidden from support — support cannot browse all private conversations.
6. **Reported tab** (all admin roles including support): sees flagged messages. Can dismiss (clears `reported` flag) via `DELETE /api/messages/[id]/report`. This is the primary job of the support tier.
7. **Users tab** (moderator+): search/filter by role or status. Can view seller listings, suspend (moderator+ for non-dealers), unsuspend (admin+), edit name/email (admin+), promote to dealer (superadmin), delete account (superadmin). Hidden from support.
8. **Applications tab** (admin+): review dealer applications, approve or reject with optional note.
9. **Team tab** (superadmin only): view team members, add members by email with role selection, remove members.

### 2.6 Buyer Messaging a Seller

1. On listing detail page, buyer clicks "Contact Seller" (must be logged in).
2. `POST /api/conversations` — rate limit 20/hour/IP; suspension check; finds/creates conversation; inserts message; fires Supabase Realtime broadcast to seller's `notifications:${sellerId}` channel.
3. Seller receives real-time notification (if subscribed via `messenger-context`).
4. Either party opens `/messages` or the in-page chat widget.
5. `GET /api/conversations/[id]/messages` — verifies participant (buyer or seller); returns message list.
6. `POST /api/conversations/[id]/messages` — suspension check; verifies participant; inserts message; updates `last_message_at`; broadcasts to recipient.
7. Either party can flag a message via `PATCH /api/messages/[id]/report` (sets `reported: true`).
8. Admin sees reported messages in Reported tab; can dismiss via `DELETE /api/messages/[id]/report`.

### 2.7 Price Drop / Sold Notifications

**Price Drop (immediate)**:
1. Seller edits listing (`PATCH /api/listings/[id]`) and lowers price.
2. API detects `newPrice < oldPrice` → inserts `price_history` row → fire-and-forget `POST /api/notify-watchers`.
3. `notify-watchers` fetches car details and all watchers → emails each watcher with old/new price comparison.

**Price Drop (weekly batch)**:
- `POST /api/email/price-drops` (Bearer `ADMIN_API_SECRET`) — finds all `price_history` rows from past 7 days → groups by watcher → sends digest email per user.

**Sold Notification**:
1. Dealer calls `POST /api/cars/sold` → sets `is_sold: true`.
2. Fire-and-forget: fetches all watchlist users → emails each: "{Car} has sold — browse similar listings."

## 3. Database Tables & Fields

All tables are in Supabase Postgres. Fields derived from code reads; no migration files were read, so nullable/non-null constraints are inferred from code usage (nullable = field sometimes null-checked or defaulted).

### `listings`

| Field | Type (inferred) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid / text | Primary key; `crypto.randomUUID()` for private sellers; `${dealerId}-${Date.now()}` for dealers |
| `slug` | text | URL-safe slug, e.g. `1969-dodge-charger-1234567890` |
| `title` | text | Auto-computed: `${year} ${make} ${model}` |
| `year` | integer | |
| `make` | text | |
| `model` | text | |
| `price` | integer | 0 = "Call for price" |
| `mileage` | integer \| null | |
| `location` | text | City |
| `state` | text | 2-char state code |
| `condition` | text | Excellent / Good / Fair / Project |
| `body_style` | text | Coupe / Convertible / Sedan / etc. |
| `transmission` | text | Manual / Automatic |
| `engine` | text \| null | Free text, e.g. "396 V8" |
| `color` | text \| null | Exterior color |
| `interior_color` | text \| null | |
| `seat_material` | text \| null | Leather / Cloth / Vinyl / Suede / Alcantara |
| `seating_type` | text \| null | Bucket / Bench / Sport Bucket |
| `horsepower` | integer \| null | Dealer only |
| `torque` | integer \| null | Dealer only |
| `cylinders` | integer \| null | Dealer only |
| `displacement` | text \| null | Dealer only, e.g. "6.2L" |
| `forced_induction` | text \| null | Supercharged / Turbocharged / etc. |
| `fuel_type` | text \| null | Gasoline / Diesel / Electric / Hybrid / Flex Fuel |
| `num_speeds` | integer \| null | Dealer only |
| `drive_type` | text \| null | RWD / FWD / AWD / 4WD |
| `images` | text[] | Array of Supabase Storage public URLs |
| `description` | text | |
| `headline` | text \| null | Rich listing headline (seed data / future use) |
| `hobby_segment` | text \| null | e.g. "Muscle Car" |
| `doors` | integer \| null | |
| `rear_wheel_spec` | text \| null | |
| `options` | text[] \| null | |
| `description_paragraphs` | text[] \| null | |
| `lot_number` | text \| null | |
| `vin` | text \| null | |
| `vin_verified` | boolean | Default false |
| `vin_make` | text \| null | From NHTSA |
| `vin_model` | text \| null | From NHTSA |
| `vin_year` | integer \| null | From NHTSA |
| `seller_id` | uuid \| null | FK to auth.users |
| `seller_name` | text | |
| `seller_phone` | text | |
| `seller_email` | text | |
| `featured` | boolean | Default false |
| `status` | text | pending / approved / rejected |
| `rejection_reason` | text \| null | |
| `resubmission_note` | text \| null | Seller's note on what was fixed |
| `resubmission_count` | integer | Default 0 |
| `listed_at` | **text** \| null | Set on approval; despite the name/prior docs this is actually stored as text, not timestamptz — confirmed 2026-07-02 when a migration's date-arithmetic UPDATE failed with `operator does not exist: text + interval` until an explicit `::timestamptz` cast was added |
| `is_sold` | boolean | Default false |
| `sold_at` | timestamptz \| null | |
| `sold_price` | integer \| null | |
| `expires_at` | timestamptz \| null | Added 2026-07-02. Set to `listed_at + 30 days` on approval; listings past this date are excluded from all public browse/search queries (still viewable at their direct URL). Seller can push it out another 30 days via `POST /api/listings/[id]/renew`. |
| `is_feed_managed` | boolean | Added 2026-07-02, default false. Set true by `syncDealerFeed()` (`app/api/cron/dealer-feed-sync/route.ts`) on both insert and update, as of 2026-07-22. Feed-managed listings skip the manual renewal flow (`POST /api/listings/[id]/renew` rejects if true) and are excluded from the expiring-listings reminder email; their freshness is driven by the daily/on-demand sync instead. |
| `stock_number` | text \| null | Added 2026-07-22. Fallback match key for dealer feed sync when a feed row has no VIN — unique within a single dealer's inventory only, never used to match across dealers. |
| `renewal_reminder_sent_at` | timestamptz \| null | Added 2026-07-03. Set when a renewal reminder email is sent; prevents duplicate reminder sends. |
| `views` | integer | Used in dealer-report email (may be a denormalized column) |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Auto-managed by Supabase |

### `dealers`

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | text | Same value as auth.users.id (stored as text, not uuid, in the live schema — corrected 2026-07-12) |
| `slug` | text | URL-safe name |
| `name` | text | Dealership name |
| `phone` | text \| null | |
| `email` | text \| null | |
| `address` | text \| null | Street address |
| `location` | text | City |
| `state` | text | 2-char |
| `zip` | text \| null | |
| `description` | text \| null | |
| `website` | text \| null | |
| `specialties` | text[] | |
| `since` | integer \| null | Year established |
| `logo` | text \| null | URL |
| `plan` | text \| null | e.g. 'beta' |
| `beta_expires_at` | timestamptz \| null | Set to +6 months on approval |
| `report_opt_out` | boolean | Default false; set true via `/unsubscribe/dealer-report`; skipped by monthly report job |
| `feed_url` | text \| null | Added 2026-07-22. Dealer-configured CSV data-feed URL (Settings → Feed Sync); when set, this dealer is eligible for `GET /api/cron/dealer-feed-sync` and `POST /api/dealer/feed-sync` (on-demand "Sync now"). |
| `feed_sync_hour` | smallint \| null | Added 2026-07-22. UTC hour (0–23) the dealer chose for their daily automatic sync; the hourly cron only syncs dealers whose `feed_sync_hour` matches the current UTC hour, so each dealer gets one automatic sync/day despite the cron firing every hour. Null = no automatic schedule, on-demand "Sync now" only. |
| `feed_last_synced_at` | timestamptz \| null | Added 2026-07-22. Stamped after every sync (cron or on-demand). |
| `feed_last_sync_summary` | text \| null | Added 2026-07-22. Human-readable one-line result of the last sync, e.g. `"3 inserted, 1 updated, 0 sold, 0 skipped"` or `"Error: ..."`; shown in the dashboard's Feed Sync settings section. |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | |

### `dealer_locations`

Added 2026-07-22 for dealers with more than one physical showroom (e.g. Survivor Classic Car Services — Tampa/Chicago/Atlanta). One-to-many with `dealers`. RLS: public read; owner-only write, matched via `dealer_id = auth.uid()::text` (since `dealers.id` is text, not uuid).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | PK, `gen_random_uuid()` |
| `dealer_id` | text | FK to `dealers.id`, `ON DELETE CASCADE` |
| `city` | text | |
| `state` | text | 2-char |
| `address` | text \| null | |
| `zip` | text \| null | |
| `phone` | text \| null | |
| `email` | text \| null | |
| `is_primary` | boolean | Default false. Setting a location primary (via `POST`/`PATCH /api/dealer/locations`) mirrors its address/city/state/zip/phone/email onto the dealer's own row, so the ~7 existing places in the codebase that read those `dealers` fields directly keep working unchanged. |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Default `now()` |

Shown on the dealer's public page (`app/dealers/[slug]/page.tsx`) as an "Our Locations" section, only when 2+ locations exist — otherwise identical to the single-address behavior. Not editable from the admin panel; admin doesn't edit any other dealer profile field today, so this was deliberately kept dealer-self-service-only rather than adding the one inconsistent admin exception.

### `dealer_applications`

| `status` | text | pending / approved / rejected |
| `rejection_note` | text \| null | |
| `reviewed_at` | timestamptz \| null | |
| `reviewed_by` | uuid \| null | FK to auth.users (admin) |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | |
| `dealer_id` | text \| null | FK to `dealers(id)`, `on delete set null`. Set on approval to the exact dealer row created — not matched by email, so a deleted dealer's account can't be confused with a later application that reuses the same email (added 2026-07-12) |

### `admin_users`

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `user_id` | uuid | FK to auth.users; PK |

| `mileage_max` | integer \| null | |
| `condition` | text[] \| null | Array of conditions |
| `body_style` | text \| null | |
| `transmission` | text \| null | |
| `state` | text \| null | |
| `active` | boolean | Default true |

Used to gate free access when paid plans launch. |

**`handle_new_user_profile()` trigger** (added 2026-07-10): `AFTER INSERT ON auth.users`, `SECURITY DEFINER`. Inserts a `profiles` row from `NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name'` (and applies the same `promo` → `promo_expires_at` logic as the old client-side code), but only when `raw_app_meta_data->>'provider'` is `'email'` (or unset) — Google/Facebook signups are deliberately excluded so this trigger can't race the existing OAuth profile-seeding + promo logic in `/auth/callback`, which already handles those providers correctly. Replaced a client-side `profiles.upsert()` call in `app/account/signup/page.tsx` that ran immediately after `auth.signUp()` — since this project requires email confirmation, `signUp()` returns no session until the confirmation link is clicked, so that upsert always ran unauthenticated and was silently blocked by RLS. `full_name` is now also passed into `signUp()`'s `options.data`, which writes to `user_metadata` immediately (no session required) and is what the trigger reads.

### `site_settings`

Added 2026-07-11. Single-row singleton (`id` is always `1`), superadmin-editable from `/admin` → Team tab → "Trial & Promo Settings". Read via `lib/siteSettings.ts`'s `getSiteSettings()`, which falls back to the defaults below if the row/table is missing or the query errors — so nothing changes behaviorally until a superadmin actually edits a value. RLS enabled with no policies (service-role/admin-client access only).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | int | PK, always `1` (`check (id = 1)` enforces singleton) |
| `promo_application_cutoff` | timestamptz | Default `2026-12-31T00:00:00Z` (was `2026-08-01`, extended 2026-07-13). Dealer/advertiser signups submitted before this instant qualify for the promo rate — this is the code-level fallback; the live DB row (if one exists) must be updated separately via `/admin` → Team tab, since `getSiteSettings()` only falls back to this default when the row/table is missing. |
| `promo_expires_at` | timestamptz | Default `2026-12-31T23:59:59Z` (was `2026-10-31`, extended 2026-07-13). Free access ends on this date for promo dealers/sellers/advertisers; also drives the `cron/promo-expiry` send window (cutoff − 14 days through cutoff + 1 day). |
| `advertiser_trial_days` | int | Default `14`. Applied to every new advertiser signup. |
| `dealer_default_trial_days` | int | Default `180` (~6 months). Applied to dealer applications submitted on/after `promo_application_cutoff`. Replaces the old calendar-month math (`setMonth(+6)`, which varied 181-184 days depending on the month) with a fixed, precise day count. |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz | |
| `updated_by` | uuid \| null | FK to `auth.users`, the superadmin who last saved a change |

**Per-account override:** these settings only affect *new* signups/approvals. To adjust an *existing* dealer's `beta_expires_at` or advertiser's `trial_ends_at` individually, any admin-role team member can use the Edit action in the Users tab (see `PATCH /api/admin/users` below) — independent of, and unaffected by, changes to `site_settings`.

## 4. API Contract

### `POST /api/listings/submit`
- **Auth**: required — unauthenticated users see `SellGate` before reaching the form; `sellerId` is always set from the session
- **Rate limit**: 5 requests / IP / hour
- **Suspension check**: yes — suspended users blocked with 403 before any DB writes
- **State validation**: `state` must be a valid US state/territory code from `lib/constants.ts US_STATES` — returns 400 if invalid
- **Seller identity**: `seller_name` and `seller_phone` are read from the `profiles` table (keyed by `user.id`); `seller_email` is taken from `user.email`. These are **not** form fields — they are never submitted by the client.
- **Input** (multipart/form-data):

| Field | Required | Type | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cf-turnstile-response` | yes | string | Verified via Cloudflare |
| `year` | yes | number | Numeric |
| `make` | yes | string | From MAKES list |
| `model` | yes | string | |
| `price` | yes | number | `Number() \|\| 0` |
| `mileage` | no | number | Null if blank |
| `city` | yes | string | Stored as `location` |
| `state` | yes | string | |
| `condition` | yes | string | |
| `bodyStyle` | no | string | |
| `transmission` | no | string | |
| `engine` | no | string | Null if blank |
| `color` | no | string | Null if blank |
| `description` | yes | string | |
| `imageUrls` | yes | JSON string | Array of Supabase URLs; capped at 20; must match our Supabase domain and `/listing-images/` path |
| `vin` | no | string | Optional; stored as-is |
| `vinVerified` | no | string | `'true'` if user verified via NHTSA; stored as `vin_verified` boolean |

- **Business rules checked**:
  - If `BETA_MODE !== 'true'` and seller is a dealer with expired `beta_expires_at` → 403 `BETA_EXPIRED`
  - If `BETA_MODE !== 'true'` and seller is NOT a dealer and has ≥ 10 pending/approved listings → 403 `LISTING_LIMIT`
- **Success**: `200 { success: true }`
- **Errors**: 400 (CAPTCHA), 403 (limit), 429 (rate limit), 500
- **Side effects**: inserts `listings` row with `status: 'pending'`; sends admin notification on rate limit hit

---

### `PATCH /api/listings/[id]`
- **Auth**: required (user session)
- **Rate limit**: none
- **Suspension check**: yes — suspended users blocked with 403 before ownership check
- **Beta expiry check**: yes — dealers with expired `beta_expires_at` blocked with 403 `BETA_EXPIRED` (respects `BETA_MODE` bypass)
- **Input** (JSON):

| Field | Required | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `year` | no | number | |
| `make` | no | string | |
| `model` | no | string | Auto-regenerates `title` when year/make/model change |
| `body_style` | no | string | |
| `condition` | no | string | |
| `fuel_type` | no | string \| null | |
| `engine` | no | string \| null | |
| `transmission` | no | string | |
| `color` | no | string \| null | Exterior color |
| `interior_color` | no | string \| null | |
| `seat_material` | no | string \| null | |
| `city` | no | string | Stored as `location` |
| `state` | no | string | |
| `price` | no | number | |
| `mileage` | no | number \| null | Null if blank |
| `description` | no | string | |
| `images` | no | string[] | |
| `resubmission_note` | conditional | string | Required if listing status is 'rejected' |

- **Ownership**: verifies `listing.seller_id === user.id`
- **Status transitions**: rejected → pending (requires `resubmission_note`); approved → pending (any edit)
- **Success**: `200 { success: true }`
- **Side effects**: if price drops, inserts `price_history`, fires `POST /api/notify-watchers`

---

### `DELETE /api/listings/[id]`
- **Auth**: required
- **Ownership**: verifies `listing.seller_id === user.id`
- **Side effects**: removes images from `listing-images` storage bucket; deletes linked `conversations`
- **Success**: `200 { success: true }`

---

### `GET /api/listings/my`
- **Auth**: required
- **Returns**: `{ listings: Listing[] }` — all listings for current user ordered by `created_at` desc
- **Fields returned**: id, slug, title, year, make, model, price, mileage, condition, body_style, transmission, engine, color, location, state, images, description, seller_name, seller_phone, seller_email, status, rejection_reason, resubmission_note, resubmission_count, created_at, featured

---

### `POST /api/listings/upload-image`
- **Auth**: required
- **Input** (JSON): `{ fileName: string, contentType: string }`
- **Validation**: contentType used to determine extension (png/webp/jpg)
- **Returns**: `{ signedUrl, token, path, publicUrl }`
- **Side effects**: creates signed upload URL in `listing-images` bucket; client PUTs directly to Supabase

---

### `GET /api/admin/listings`
- **Auth**: required, min role: moderator
- **Query params**: `seller_id?`, `make?`, `model?` (partial/`ilike` match), `yearMin?`, `yearMax?`, `priceMin?`, `priceMax?`, `status?` (`pending`/`approved`/`rejected`; omit or `all` for no filter), `resubmissionsOnly?` (`'true'`), `featuredOnly?` (`'true'`), `sellerType?` (`dealer`/`private` — resolved via a lookup against the `dealers` table, since listings has no boolean column for this), `fbPosted?` (`posted`/`not_posted`), `expiringSoon?` (`'true'`, `expires_at` within 7 days), `page?` (default 1), `limit?` (default 50, max 100)
- **Sort**: year (descending) → make (ascending) → model (ascending) — fixed, not client-configurable
- **Returns**: `{ listings: [], total, page, limit, statusCounts: { pending, approved, rejected } }` — `statusCounts` are always-unfiltered totals across all listings regardless of the filters/page applied to `listings`; `listings[].seller_name`/`seller_phone` are overlaid with the live `dealers` row when `seller_id` matches a dealer, since the stored value is a one-time snapshot taken at listing creation that never updates again (fixed 2026-07-17 — see the changelog entry at the top of this file for the full staleness history)

---

### `PATCH /api/admin/listings`
- **Auth**: required, any admin role
- **Input** (JSON): `{ id, action?, ...fields }`
- **Without action** (edit): requires admin+; updates all listing fields except seller_id
- **With action='approve'**: requires moderator+; sets status='approved', listed_at=now, clears rejection fields; emails seller; triggers `/api/alerts/match`; posts to Facebook (fire-and-forget) and records `fb_posted_at` on success
- **With action='reject'**: requires moderator+; sets status='rejected', stores rejection_reason; emails seller with reason
- **With action='repost_facebook'**: requires admin+; awaited (not fire-and-forget) so the caller gets a real success/failure result; posts to the Facebook Page and records `fb_posted_at` on success; returns `{ success: boolean }`
- **Error codes**: 400 (missing id), 401 (unauthorized), 403 (forbidden), 404 (repost_facebook: listing not found), 500

---

### `DELETE /api/admin/listings`
- **Auth**: required, role: superadmin only
- **Input**: `{ id }`
- **Side effects**: removes storage images, deletes conversations, deletes listing row

---

### `GET /api/admin/users`
- **Auth**: required, min role: moderator
- **Query**: `page?`, `limit?` (default 100, max 200)
- **Returns**: rich user objects with roles array, suspended status, dealer/advertiser info, listing counts, watchlist/conversation counts

---

### `PATCH /api/admin/users`
- **Auth**: required, any admin role
- **Input**: `{ id, action, ...params }`

| action | Min role | Params |
|---|---|---|
| `suspend` | moderator | `reason?` |
| `unsuspend` | admin | — |
| `edit` | admin | `name?`, `email?`, `dealer?` (raw partial update on `dealers` incl. `beta_expires_at`), `advertiser?` (added 2026-07-11 — raw partial update on `advertisers`, keyed by `user_id` not `id`, incl. `trial_ends_at`) |
| `promote` | superadmin | `dealer: { name, location, state }` |

---

### `DELETE /api/admin/users`
- **Auth**: required, role: superadmin
- **Input**: `{ id }`
- **Side effects**: deletes suspended_users, watchlists, saved_searches, conversations; deletes listings + images; resets any `dealer_applications` row with `status='approved'` and `dealer_id=id` to `status='rejected'` (else that email is permanently blocked from re-applying — fixed 2026-07-13); deletes dealer profile; deletes auth user. (Previously also deleted from `inquiries`, filtered on a `user_id` column that table never had — a no-op that was quietly removed along with the table itself, 2026-07-14.)

---

### `POST /api/admin/users`
- **Auth**: required, role: superadmin
- **Input**: `{ email, password, name?, dealerName, location?, state? }`
- **Validation**: email, password, dealerName required
- **Side effects**: creates auth user + dealers row

---

### `GET /api/admin/dealer-applications`
- **Auth**: required, any admin role
- **Returns**: `{ applications: [] }` ordered by created_at desc

---

### `PATCH /api/admin/dealer-applications`
- **Auth**: required, min role: admin
- **Input**: `{ id, action: 'approve'|'reject', rejection_note? }`
- **On approve**: creates auth user, inserts dealer row (plan='beta'); `beta_expires_at` sourced from `getSiteSettings()` (added 2026-07-11) — the configured `promo_expires_at` if application submitted before the configured `promo_application_cutoff`, else `now + dealer_default_trial_days`; falls back to the original `2026-10-31` / `now + 6 months` behavior if `site_settings` is unset; sends welcome email with password-reset link, copy reflects the actual configured values
- **On reject**: updates status, sends rejection email with optional note

---

### `GET /api/admin/reported`
- **Auth**: required, any admin role
- **Returns**: `{ reported: [] }` — messages with `reported=true`, with conversation details

---

### `GET /api/admin/team`
- **Auth**: required, superadmin only
- **Returns**: `{ team: [{ user_id, email, role, created_at }] }`

---

### `POST /api/admin/team`
- **Auth**: required, role: superadmin
- **Input**: `{ email, role }` — role must be 'superadmin' or 'moderator' (note: code actually allows all 4 roles via UI dropdown but API validates only 'superadmin'|'moderator')
- **Validation**: target user must already have a GarageCherries account

---

### `DELETE /api/admin/team`
- **Auth**: required, role: superadmin
- **Input**: `{ user_id }`
- **Validation**: cannot remove yourself

---

### `GET /api/admin/settings`
- **Auth**: required, any admin role (same as `admin/team`'s GET — viewable, not just editable, by the whole team)
- **Returns**: `{ settings: { promoApplicationCutoff, promoExpiresAt, advertiserTrialDays, dealerDefaultTrialDays } }` via `getSiteSettings()`

---

### `PATCH /api/admin/settings`
- **Auth**: required, role: superadmin
- **Input**: `{ promoApplicationCutoff, promoExpiresAt, advertiserTrialDays, dealerDefaultTrialDays }` — dates as plain `YYYY-MM-DD` (from `<input type="date">`)
- **Validation**: both dates must parse; both day-counts must be positive integers
- **Normalization**: `promoApplicationCutoff` → start-of-day UTC; `promoExpiresAt` → end-of-day UTC
- **Side effects**: upserts the `site_settings` singleton row; records `updated_at`/`updated_by`

---

### `POST /api/admin/cleanup-images`
- **Auth**: required, role: superadmin
- **Side effects**: lists all files in `listing-images` bucket; deletes orphans (not referenced by any listing) older than 24 hours
- **Returns**: `{ deleted: number, paths?: string[] }`

---

### `POST /api/dealer/apply`
- **Auth**: none required
- **Rate limit**: 3 / IP / hour
- **State validation**: `state` must be a valid US state/territory code — returns 400 if invalid
- **Input** (JSON):

| Field | Required | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Non-empty |
| `email` | yes | Lowercased, trimmed |
| `phone` | yes | Non-empty |
| `dealerName` | yes | Non-empty |
| `address` | no | |
| `location` | yes | City |
| `state` | yes | Uppercased, max 2 chars |
| `zip` | no | |
| `website` | no | |
| `specialties` | no | Comma-separated string → array |
| `description` | yes | Non-empty |
| `captchaToken` | yes | Turnstile verification |

- **Duplicate checks**: existing dealer with email → 409; existing pending/approved application → 409
- **Success**: `200 { success: true }`

---

### `POST /api/dealer/settings`
- **Auth**: required, must own dealer record
- **Input** (JSON): `{ dealerId?, name, phone, address, location, state, zip, description, website, specialties[] }` — generic pass-through `update(fields)`, so it also accepts `feed_url`/`feed_sync_hour` (used by the Feed Sync settings section, added 2026-07-22)
- **Ownership**: verifies `dealers.id === user.id`
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true, plan, beta_expires_at }`

---

### `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/dealer/locations` (added 2026-07-22)
- **Auth**: required, must own dealer record (`requireOwnDealer`)
- **GET**: returns `{ locations: DealerLocation[] }`, all of the authenticated dealer's own `dealer_locations` rows
- **POST**: `{ city, state, address?, zip?, phone?, email?, isPrimary? }` — city/state required; inserts a new location, scoped to `dealer_id = auth.uid()`
- **PATCH**: `{ id, ...same fields }` — 404s if `id` doesn't belong to the caller's dealer
- **DELETE**: `?id=...` — 404s if `id` doesn't belong to the caller's dealer
- **Side effect**: setting a location `isPrimary` (POST or PATCH) unsets `is_primary` on the dealer's other locations, then mirrors that location's address/city/state/zip/phone/email onto the `dealers` row itself, so every existing page reading those `dealers` fields directly (dealer dashboard, public dealer page, listing seller info, etc.) keeps working with zero changes

---

### `POST /api/dealer/feed-sync` (added 2026-07-22)
- **Auth**: required, must own dealer record
- **Input**: none (uses the caller's own `dealers.feed_url`)
- **Validation**: 400 if the dealer has no `feed_url` configured
- **Behavior**: runs `syncDealerFeed()` (shared with `GET /api/cron/dealer-feed-sync`) immediately against the caller's own feed, then stamps `feed_last_synced_at`/`feed_last_sync_summary` — the dashboard's "Sync now" button
- **Returns**: `{ ok: boolean, result: FeedSyncResult, summary: string }`

---

### `GET /api/dealer/metrics`
- **Auth**: required, must be a dealer
- **Returns**: `{ views30d, viewsDelta, inquiries30d, inquiriesDelta, avgDaysOnMarket, recentInquiries[] }`
- **`avgDaysOnMarket`**: calculated from approved, non-sold listings only; guards against NaN if `listed_at` text value is unparseable (fixed 2026-07-03)
- **`inquiries30d`/`inquiriesPrev30d`/`recentInquiries`**: sourced from `conversations` (rewired 2026-07-14, previously the orphaned `inquiries` table — see `POST /api/inquire` below), scoped by `listing_id IN (dealer's listing ids)` since `conversations` has no `dealer_id` column; `recentInquiries[].message` is each conversation's first row in `messages` (`conversations` doesn't store body text itself)

---

### `GET /api/dealer/watcher-counts`
- **Auth**: required — works for both dealers and private sellers, since ownership is checked generically against `listings.seller_id = user.id` (the `/dealer/` path segment is historical, not a role gate)
- **Ownership**: carIds filtered to only those owned by the authenticated user (`seller_id = user.id`) before querying watchlists/listing_views; unowned IDs silently dropped
- **Query**: `carIds=id1,id2,...`
- **Returns**: `{ counts, messaged, views, totalWatchers }` (added `views`/`totalWatchers` 2026-07-13):
  - `counts: { [carId]: number }` — opted-in watchers not yet messaged (used only for the "Message N watchers" button)
  - `messaged: { [carId]: boolean }` — whether the dealer already messaged watchers for that car
  - `views: { [carId]: number }` — all-time count of `listing_views` rows for that listing
  - `totalWatchers: { [carId]: number }` — every `watchlists` row for that car, regardless of contact opt-in/messaged status

---

### `GET /api/admin/watcher-counts` (added 2026-07-17)
- **Auth**: required, min role: moderator
- **Ownership**: none — admin-scoped counterpart to `/api/dealer/watcher-counts` above, same `listing_views`/`watchlists` aggregation but for any listing, not just the caller's own
- **Query**: `carIds=id1,id2,...`
- **Returns**: `{ views: { [carId]: number }, totalWatchers: { [carId]: number } }`

---

### `POST /api/dealer/message-watchers`
- **Auth**: required, must be the dealer who owns the car
- **Input**: `{ carId, message }`
- **Validation**: carId and non-empty message required; car must belong to dealer
- **Side effects**: emails each eligible watcher (allow_dealer_contact=true, not yet messaged, not blocked); sets `dealer_messaged_at` after each send
- **Returns**: `{ sent: number }`

---

### `GET /api/dealer/export`
- **Auth**: required, must be a dealer
- **Query**: `format=json|csv` (default: `json`)
- **Returns**: downloadable file of all dealer's listings
  - JSON: `{ dealer, exported_at, count, listings[] }` with `Content-Disposition: attachment`
  - CSV: all listing fields as comma-separated rows with header
- **Fields included**: id, title, year, make, model, price, mileage, condition, body_style, transmission, engine, color, interior_color, horsepower, torque, cylinders, displacement, forced_induction, fuel_type, num_speeds, drive_type, location, state, description, vin, vin_verified, status, is_sold, created_at, listed_at

---

### `POST /api/advertiser/signup`
- **Auth**: none
- **Rate limit**: 3/hr/IP; first block fires `notifyAdmin` alert
- **Input**: `{ email, password, businessName, contactName?, phone?, address?, city?, state?, zip?, category?, tier?, cfToken }`
- **Validation**: email, password, businessName required; Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA verified server-side via `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` (skipped if key not set)
- **Side effects**: creates auth user + advertisers row; `trial_ends_at` = the configured `promo_expires_at` if signing up before the configured `promo_application_cutoff` (same promo-window pattern as dealer signups, added 2026-07-13), otherwise `now + getSiteSettings().advertiserTrialDays` (default 14 days, superadmin-configurable since 2026-07-11); on DB error, rolls back auth user
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true, advertiserId }`

---

### `GET /api/advertiser/ads`
- **Auth**: required, must be advertiser
- **Returns**: `{ advertiser, ads: [] }`

---

### `POST /api/advertiser/ads`
- **Auth**: required, must be advertiser
- **Input**: `{ id?, headline, bodyCopy, ctaLabel, ctaUrl, phone, logoUrl, photoUrl, rating, reviewCount }`
- **Business rule**: trial must not be expired (checked for both create and update)
- **URL validation**: `ctaUrl` must start with `http://` or `https://` — `javascript:` and other schemes rejected with 400
- **With id**: updates existing ad (ownership verified via `advertiser_id`)
- **Without id**: creates new ad
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true }` on update; `{ ad: {...} }` on create

---

### `DELETE /api/advertiser/ads`
- **Auth**: required, must be advertiser
- **Query**: `id`
- **Ownership**: verified via `advertiser_id`

---

### `GET /api/ads/serve`
- **Auth**: none
- **Query**: `state?`, `path?`
- **Logic**: finds active advertisers with valid trial; filters by radius using haversine distance between state centroids:
  - `statewide` tier: always eligible regardless of viewer state
  - All other tiers: advertiser's state centroid must be within `radius_miles` of the viewer's state centroid
  - Falls back to exact state match if viewer state is unknown
  - Picks random eligible advertiser; returns their ad with fewest impressions
- **Side effects**: logs impression to `ad_events`; increments `ads.impressions` via RPC `inc_ad_impressions`
- **Returns**: `{ ad: {...} | null }`

---

### `POST /api/ads/track`
- **Auth**: none
- **Rate limit**: 60 / IP / hour (prevents click stuffing)
- **Input**: `{ adId, type?, path?, state? }`
- **Validation**: adId required
- **Side effects**: logs to `ad_events`; increments `ads.clicks` via RPC `inc_ad_clicks`

---

### `GET /api/alerts`
- **Auth**: required
- **Returns**: `{ searches: [] }` — user's saved searches

---

### `POST /api/alerts`
- **Auth**: required
- **Input**: `{ name?, make?, model?, yearMin?, yearMax?, priceMax?, mileageMax?, condition?, bodyStyle?, transmission?, state? }`
- **Validation**: max 10 per user; at least 2 criteria required
- **Returns**: `{ search: {...} }`

---

### `PATCH /api/alerts`
- **Auth**: required
- **Input**: `{ id, paused?, active? }`
- **Ownership**: verified via `user_id` filter

---

### `DELETE /api/alerts`
- **Auth**: required
- **Query**: `id`
- **Ownership**: verified

---

### `POST /api/alerts/match`
- **Auth**: Bearer `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` header required — returns 401 if missing or mismatched
- **Caller**: only `PATCH /api/admin/listings` (approve action) passes the secret header; no public access
- **Input**: `{ carId }`
- **Side effects**: fetches listing, calls `matchAndNotifyAlerts(car)` — emails matching alert subscribers

---

### `GET /api/alerts/matches`
- **Auth**: required
- **Query**: `alertId`
- **Ownership**: verifies alert belongs to current user
- **Returns**: `{ listings: [] }` — up to 20 most recent matches with listing details

---

### `POST /api/conversations`
- **Auth**: required
- **Rate limit**: 20 / IP / hour
- **Suspension check**: yes
- **Input**: `{ listingId, listingTitle?, buyerName?, message }`
- **Validation**: listingId and non-empty message required
- **Side effects**: finds or creates conversation; inserts first message; updates `last_message_at`; broadcasts Realtime event
- **Returns**: `{ conversationId }`

---

### `GET /api/conversations`
- **Auth**: required
- **Query**: `page?`, `limit?`
- **Returns**: `{ conversations: [], userId, total, page, limit }` — merged buyer + seller conversations sorted by `last_message_at`

---

### `GET /api/conversations/[id]/messages`
- **Auth**: required; must be buyer or seller of the listing
- **Returns**: `{ messages: [] }` — ordered by `created_at` asc

---

### `POST /api/conversations/[id]/messages`
- **Auth**: required; must be participant; suspension check
- **Rate limit**: 60 / IP / hour
- **Input**: `{ body, senderName? }`
- **Validation**: non-empty body
- **Side effects**: inserts message; updates `last_message_at`; broadcasts Realtime to recipient

---

### `PATCH /api/messages/[id]/report`
- **Auth**: required; must be conversation participant
- **Side effects**: sets `reported = true`
- **Returns**: `{ success: true }`

---

### `DELETE /api/messages/[id]/report`
- **Auth**: required, any admin role
- **Side effects**: clears `reported = false` (dismiss report)

---

### `POST /api/watchlist`
- **Auth**: required
- **Rate limit**: 60 / IP / hour
- **Input**: `{ carId, currentPrice?, allowDealerContact? }`
- **Logic**: if exists → delete (unwatch); if not → insert (watch)
- **Returns**: `{ watching: boolean }`

---

### `DELETE /api/watchlist`
- **Auth**: required
- **Query**: `carId`
- **Returns**: `{ watching: false }`

---

~~### `POST /api/inquire`~~ — **deleted 2026-07-14**, along with the `inquiries` table it wrote to. Had no live caller since the "Message Seller" button moved to `POST /api/conversations` instead (`components/ContactSellerForm.tsx` → `MessengerWidget`, a two-way thread, visible to buyers on `/account`'s Messages tab). Confirmed orphaned via repo-wide search before removal. The dealer-facing consumers that used to read `inquiries` (`GET /api/dealer/metrics`, `POST /api/email/dealer-report`) were rewired to read `conversations` instead first — see those entries below.

---

### `POST /api/offers`

- **Rate limit**: 10 / IP / hour
- **Input**: `{ carId, carTitle, dealerId, amount, buyerName?, buyerEmail, message? }`
- **Validation**: carId, amount, buyerEmail required; amount > 0
- **Side effects**: inserts `offers` row; emails dealer (if email found); sends confirmation to buyer
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true, offerId }`

---

### `GET /api/reviews`
- **Auth**: none
- **Query**: `dealerId`
- **Returns**: `{ reviews: [] }` — up to 50, ordered by `created_at` desc

---

### `POST /api/reviews`
- **Auth**: required
- **Input**: `{ dealerId, rating, review?, reviewerName? }`
- **Validation**: dealerId and rating required; rating 1–5; one review per user per dealer
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true }`

---

### `POST /api/track-view`
- **Auth**: none
- **Input**: `{ listingId, dealerId }`
- **Side effects**: deduplicates by hashed IP per listing per day; inserts `listing_views` row if new
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true }`

---

### `POST /api/notify-watchers`
- **Auth**: required — must be authenticated seller who owns the listing
- **Rate limit**: 30 / IP / hour
- **Ownership**: verifies `listing.seller_id === user.id` — returns 403 if not owner
- **Input**: `{ carId, oldPrice, newPrice }`
- **Validation**: only notifies if newPrice < oldPrice
- **Side effects**: emails all watchlist users for that car
- **Returns**: `{ sent: number }`

---

### `POST /api/cars/sold`
- **Auth**: required; ownership verified (`seller_id === user.id`)
- **Input**: `{ carId, soldPrice? }`
- **Side effects**: sets `is_sold=true`, `sold_at=now`, `sold_price`; emails all watchlist users (fire-and-forget)
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true }`

---

### `POST /api/listings/[id]/renew`
- **Added**: 2026-07-02, part of the 30-day listing expiry system (see `expires_at` in the `listings` schema above)
- **Auth**: required; ownership verified (`seller_id === user.id`); rejects if `status !== 'approved'` or `is_feed_managed === true`
- **Side effects**: sets `expires_at = now + 30 days`
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true, expiresAt }`
- **Renewal reminder**: `POST /api/email/expiring-listings` sends reminder emails 3 days before expiry (added 2026-07-03)

---

### `POST /api/email/expiring-listings`
- **Added**: 2026-07-03
- **Auth**: Bearer `ADMIN_API_SECRET` header
- **Side effects**: finds approved, unsold, non-feed-managed listings where `expires_at` is within 3 days and `renewal_reminder_sent_at IS NULL`; emails each seller a renewal reminder; sets `renewal_reminder_sent_at` to prevent duplicate sends
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true, sent, total }`
- **Note**: safe to run daily — idempotent via `renewal_reminder_sent_at` guard; triggerable from `/admin/email` page

---

### `POST /api/cars/verify-vin`
- **Auth**: none
- **Rate limit**: 20 / IP / hour
- **Input**: `{ vin, make?, model?, year? }`
- **Validation**: VIN required; 17-char VINs validated against `/^[A-HJ-NPR-Z0-9]{17}$/`; pre-1981 VINs (< 17 chars) accepted with note
- **Side effects**: calls NHTSA VIN decoder API (cached 24h)
- **Returns**: `{ vinValid, verified, nhtsaMake, nhtsaModel, nhtsaYear, makeMatch, modelMatch, yearMatch, message, nicbUrl, preStandard? }` — `makeMatch`/`modelMatch`/`yearMatch` are `null` when that field wasn't provided to compare against (distinct from `false`, an explicit mismatch); `verified` requires at least one field to explicitly agree, so a VIN checked with all three fields blank always resolves `verified: false` even on a clean decode — `app/sell/SellClient.tsx` handles this client-side (all three `null` ⇒ show "VIN Decoded" instead of "Partial Match") rather than the API changing `verified`'s meaning for its other caller semantics. **For `preStandard` (pre-1981, <17 char) VINs, `nhtsaMake`/`nhtsaModel`/`nhtsaYear` are omitted from the response entirely** (`route.ts:20-30` returns early before calling NHTSA) — the client's Year/Make/Model auto-fill naturally no-ops for these since there's nothing to fill from; confirmed working as intended.

---

### `GET /api/makes`
- **Auth**: none
- **Returns**: `{ makes: string[] }` — distinct makes from `listings` table, sorted

---

### `GET /api/account/profile`
- **Auth**: required
- **Returns**: `{ profile: { id, full_name, phone } }`

---

### `POST /api/account/profile`
- **Auth**: required
- **Input**: `{ full_name?, phone? }`
- **Side effects**: upserts `profiles` row
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true }`

---

### `POST /api/email/price-drops`
- **Auth**: Bearer `ADMIN_API_SECRET` header
- **Side effects**: finds price_history rows from past 7 days; groups watchers by car; sends digest email per user showing all price-dropped watchlist cars
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true, sent, message? }`

---

### `POST /api/email/digest`
- **Auth**: Bearer `ADMIN_API_SECRET` header
- **Side effects**: fetches last 10 new listings (7 days); finds watchlist users who haven't opted out (`digest_opt_out` not set in user_metadata); sends weekly new listings digest
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true, sent, total }`

---

### `POST /api/email/dealer-report`
- **Auth**: Bearer `ADMIN_API_SECRET` header
- **Side effects**: for each dealer with email: fetches their listings, active/sold counts, total views (30d, from `listing_views` — rewired 2026-07-14, previously read a `listings.views` column that's never incremented anywhere and always reported 0), inquiry count (30d, from `conversations` — rewired 2026-07-14, previously the orphaned `inquiries` table); sends monthly performance report
- **Returns**: `{ ok: true, sent, total }`

## 5. Business Rules

| Rule | File:Line | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Private seller listing limit | `app/api/listings/submit/route.ts:44` | Max 10 active (pending + approved) listings per private seller; dealers exempt |
| Beta mode bypass | `app/api/listings/submit/route.ts:29` | `BETA_MODE=true` env var bypasses the 10-listing cap entirely — useful during pre-launch testing; set to `false` (or omit) in production |
| Dealer beta expiry | `app/api/listings/submit/route.ts`, `app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts` | If dealer's `beta_expires_at < now`, 403 BETA_EXPIRED on listing submit and listing edit; dashboard access and metrics not blocked |
| Dealer beta period duration | `app/api/admin/dealer-applications/route.ts` | Superadmin-configurable since 2026-07-11 via `site_settings` (`/admin` → Team tab). Code-level defaults (used only if the row is missing) extended 2026-07-13: applications before `2026-12-31` → `beta_expires_at = 2026-12-31T23:59:59Z`; all others → `now + 180 days`. **The live `site_settings` row must be updated separately** — it existed with the old `2026-08-01`/`2026-10-31` dates as of 2026-07-13 and only changes when a superadmin edits it |
| Advertiser promo expiry | `app/api/advertiser/signup/route.ts` | Same promo-window pattern as dealer beta (added 2026-07-13): signups before the configured `promo_application_cutoff` get `trial_ends_at = promo_expires_at` instead of `now + advertiserTrialDays` |
| Individual promo expiry | `app/auth/callback/route.ts` (Google/Facebook), `handle_new_user_profile()` DB trigger (email/password) | Signup with `promo=250th` stores `promo_expires_at = 2026-12-31T23:59:59Z` on `profiles` row; both paths had independent hardcoded `2026-10-31` literals, both fixed 2026-07-13. Enforced when paid plans launch |
| Promo modal date gate | `components/PromoModal.tsx` | Modal stops displaying after `2026-12-31T23:59:59` (updated 2026-07-13 from `2026-07-31`); date check runs client-side on mount |
| Advertiser trial period | `app/api/advertiser/signup/route.ts:28` | `trial_ends_at = now + 14 days`; ad creation AND editing blocked if expired |
| Advertiser tier → radius | `app/api/advertiser/signup/route.ts:26` | starter=15mi, metro=30mi, regional=60mi, statewide=9999mi |
| Ad serving radius filter | `app/api/ads/serve/route.ts` | statewide tier serves everywhere; other tiers use haversine distance between state centroids vs. `radius_miles`; falls back to exact state match if viewer state unknown |
| Ad CTA URL scheme | `app/api/advertiser/ads/route.ts` | `cta_url` must start with `http://` or `https://`; `javascript:` and other schemes rejected with 400 |
| State code validation | `app/api/listings/submit/route.ts`, `app/api/dealer/apply/route.ts` | `state` field validated against `US_STATES` set in `lib/constants.ts` (50 states + DC + territories); invalid codes return 400 |
| Max alerts per user | `app/api/alerts/route.ts:31` | Max 10 saved searches per user |
| Alert minimum criteria | `app/api/alerts/route.ts:39` | At least 2 criteria required to create an alert |
| Alert match threshold | `lib/matchAlerts.ts:45` | Score must be ≥ 0.7 to trigger notification |
| Alert cooldown | `lib/matchAlerts.ts:121` | 24-hour cooldown per alert before re-emailing |
| Alert duplicate prevention | `lib/matchAlerts.ts:127` | `alert_matches` table prevents emailing same car for same alert twice |
| Max images per listing | `app/api/listings/submit/route.ts:63` | Server caps at 20 images (client allows up to 30 in UI) |
| Image URL validation | `app/api/listings/submit/route.ts:57` | Must start with https://, must include Supabase URL, must include `/listing-images/` |
| Resubmission note required | `app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts:39` | When resubmitting a rejected listing, `resubmission_note` must be non-empty |
| Approved listing re-review | `app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts:45` | Editing an approved listing sends it back to pending |
| Suspension blocks messaging | `app/api/conversations/route.ts:20`, `/[id]/messages/route.ts:50` | Suspended users cannot start conversations or send messages |
| VIN standard year cutoff | `app/api/cars/verify-vin/route.ts:14` | VINs < 17 chars (pre-1981) accepted but not decoded via NHTSA |
| VIN character validation | `app/api/cars/verify-vin/route.ts:28` | Must match `/^[A-HJ-NPR-Z0-9]{17}$/` — no I, O, or Q |
| Watcher contact one-time | `app/api/dealer/message-watchers/route.ts:82` | `dealer_messaged_at` set after send; prevents future sends to same watcher for that car |
| Watchlist contact opt-in | `app/api/dealer/watcher-counts/route.ts:25` | Only counts watchers where `allow_dealer_contact=true AND dealer_contact_blocked=false AND dealer_messaged_at IS NULL` |
| View deduplication | `app/api/track-view/route.ts:23` | One view counted per hashed IP per listing per day |
| Orphan image age | `app/api/admin/cleanup-images/route.ts:8` | Only deletes orphans older than 24 hours; orphans can only occur if images upload successfully on submit but the subsequent listing insert fails (narrow window) |
| Dealer promotion source | `app/api/admin/users/route.ts:163` | Only superadmin can promote a seller to dealer; only sellers (not already dealers) can be promoted |
| Cannot remove yourself from admin | `app/api/admin/team/route.ts:59` | Superadmin cannot remove their own team record |
| Ownership cannot be reassigned | `app/api/admin/listings/route.ts:52` | `seller_id` is never updated via admin PATCH |
| Dealer listing bypasses review | `app/dealer/dashboard/page.tsx:163` | Dealer-added listings inserted directly with `status: 'approved'`; private seller listings require review |
| Rate limit notification | `lib/rateLimit.ts:40`, various routes | `firstBlock` flag used to send one-time admin email on first block in window |
| Sold listings excluded from public showcase surfaces | `app/page.tsx`, `app/listings/page.tsx`, `lib/db.ts:fetchCars` | Homepage (Featured/Recently Listed), `/listings` search, and `fetchCars()` (used by encyclopedia model pages' "live listings") all filter `is_sold = false`; the listing detail page and `/sold` archive intentionally keep sold listings visible elsewhere |
| `fetchCars()` status/expiry scoping | `lib/db.ts:86-89` | Previously had no filtering at all — pending and rejected listings could appear publicly on encyclopedia model pages, bypassing admin review. Now scoped to `status='approved'`, not expired, not sold, matching the homepage/`/listings` pattern |
| Client-side image resize before upload | `lib/resizeImage.ts` | Applied on `/sell`, `/account` listing edit, and dealer Add/Edit Vehicle — downscales to fit 1920px on the long edge, re-encodes JPEG at 82% quality, preserves EXIF orientation; skips images already under the threshold; falls back to the original file on decode failure |
| Session forced-logout on deleted/invalid account | `components/SessionGuard.tsx` | Supabase sessions are stateless JWTs, so deleting a user doesn't revoke an already-issued token. If a same-origin `/api/` call returns 401 while the browser still holds a local session, that mismatch triggers `signOut()` + redirect to `/account/login?reason=session_ended`. Scoped narrowly — a normal logged-out 401 doesn't trigger it |

## 6. Validation Rules

### Listing Submit (`POST /api/listings/submit`)

| Field | Required | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cf-turnstile-response` | yes | string | Verified via Cloudflare Turnstile |
| `year` | yes | number | `Number()` coercion |
| `make` | yes | string | Sent as string |
| `model` | yes | string | Sent as string |
| `price` | yes | number | `Number() \|\| 0` |
| `mileage` | no | number | Null if absent |
| `city` | yes | string | |
| `state` | yes | string | |
| `condition` | yes | string | |
| `bodyStyle` | no | string | |
| `transmission` | no | string | |
| `engine` | no | string | Stored null if blank |
| `color` | no | string | Stored null if blank |
| `description` | yes | string | |
| `imageUrls` | yes | JSON array | URLs validated: https, match supabaseUrl, contain /listing-images/; capped at 20 |

**Note:** `sellerName`, `sellerPhone`, and `sellerEmail` are not form fields — the API reads them server-side from `profiles` and `auth.users`.

### Client-side form validation (`SellClient.tsx`, via the shared `VehicleFieldsForm` component)

Rewritten 2026-07-14 — this table previously described the dead `SellForm.tsx` (deleted 2026-07-14) and predated the 2026-07-13 field unification across `/sell`/dealer/admin.

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `year` | type=number, required, min=1900, max=2030 |
| `make` | required dropdown |
| `model` | required text |
| `condition` | required dropdown |
| `bodyStyle` | required dropdown |
| `fuelType` | required dropdown |
| `transmission` | required dropdown (Electric fuelType restricts to "1-Speed" only) |
| `driveType` | required dropdown |
| `price` | required text (numeric, comma-formatted) |
| `description` | required textarea |
| `mileage`, `engine`, `color` | optional |
| `city`, `state` | optional as of 2026-07-13 (previously both required); `state` is still validated against US state codes server-side if provided |
| `vin` | optional; uppercased; max 17 chars; positioned above Year/Make/Model as of 2026-07-14 — "Verify VIN" auto-fills any of those three still blank from a clean NHTSA decode |
| photos | required, ≥1, up to 30 |

**Removed (2026-07-06):** `sellerName`, `sellerPhone`, `sellerEmail` fields — seller identity now sourced from `profiles` table server-side.

### Dealer Application (`POST /api/dealer/apply`)

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `name` | required, non-empty |
| `email` | required, lowercased, trimmed |

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `listingId` | required |
| `message` | required, `.trim()` non-empty |

### Message body (`POST /api/conversations/[id]/messages`)

|---|---|
| `body` | required, `.trim()` non-empty |

### VIN (`POST /api/cars/verify-vin`)

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| `vin` | required |
| Length | < 17 chars = pre-standard, accepted with note |

### Password change (client-side only, not API-validated)

| Advertiser public pages | **Complete (2026-07-06)** | `/advertisers` — directory grouped by category; `/advertisers/[slug]` — profile page with business info, description, phone/website, active ads. `slug`, `description`, `website` columns added via `supabase/migrations/20260706_advertiser_public_profile.sql`. Slug auto-generated from `business_name` on signup. |
| Sitemap expansion | **Complete (2026-07-09, updated 2026-07-17)** | `app/sitemap.ts` covers: all static pages (incl. `/events`, `/dealer/apply`, `/advertiser/signup`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/contact`, `/feedback`), listings (individual + make + make/model combos, now filtered to `status = 'approved'` only — was unfiltered, so rejected listings produced dead 404 links and pending ones surfaced unreviewed content), dealer pages, encyclopedia index + make + model pages (101 models across 21 makes, incl. the `/cars/srt` brand-overview page), advertiser directory + individual profiles, guide articles (6). Revalidates every 5 minutes (was hourly — found live that 6 of 8 real listings were unreachable via the sitemap right after creation because the cached version hadn't regenerated yet). |
| Contact page | **Complete (2026-07-09)** | Simplified to single email `contact-us@garagecherries.com`; fake department emails removed; dealer apply link fixed (`/dealer/apply`); links to `/feedback`; private seller FAQ updated. |
| Feedback page | **Complete (2026-07-09)** | `/feedback` — category selector (Bug / Feature Request / General), message textarea, optional email (pre-populated if logged in via `supabase.auth.getUser()`); `POST /api/feedback` rate-limited 5/hr/IP, emails `contact-us@garagecherries.com` via Resend with reply-to set to sender. Footer link added. |
| SEO — structured data (JSON-LD) | **Complete (2026-07-06)** | Organization (homepage, about, contact), AutoDealer + BreadcrumbList (dealer pages), Vehicle + BreadcrumbList (listing detail, pre-existing), Article + BreadcrumbList (encyclopedia model pages), LocalBusiness + BreadcrumbList (advertiser detail pages). |
| SEO — OG image | **Complete (updated 2026-07-09)** | `app/opengraph-image.jpg` — static file (1200×630), currently the 250th anniversary eagle promo graphic; replaced the old dynamic `app/opengraph-image.tsx` (`ImageResponse`, dark/red brand card). Served at `/opengraph-image.jpg` — note the extension, since static image files keep it in the URL unlike the dynamic version's extensionless `/opengraph-image`; `app/layout.tsx` metadata must match exactly or link previews 404 (happened in production same day, fixed same day). Swap back to a non-promo brand image after 2026-07-31. |
| SEO — sell page metadata | **Complete (2026-07-06)** | `app/sell/layout.tsx` wraps the `use client` page to export title, description, canonical. |
| Search filter clamping | **Complete (2026-07-06)** | Year inputs `min=1900 max=2030`, price inputs `min=0` (client-side HTML). `lib/db.ts` `fetchCars()` clamps year to [1900–2030] and rejects negative price server-side. |
| Google Search Console | **Complete (2026-07-06)** | Property `https://www.garagecherries.com` verified via DNS (auto-detected from GoDaddy TXT records). Sitemap submitted; 81 pages discovered, status: Success. |
| Bing Webmaster Tools | **Complete (2026-07-06)** | Imported from Google Search Console. Sitemap `https://www.garagecherries.com/sitemap.xml` submitted; status: Processing. |
| Sentry error tracking | **Complete (2026-07-06)** | `@sentry/nextjs` installed. Client, server, and edge configs in `sentry.{client,server,edge}.config.ts`; loaded via `instrumentation.ts`. `app/error.tsx` captures unhandled errors via `Sentry.captureException`. Env vars: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`. |
| Axiom structured logging | **Complete (2026-07-07)** | `next-axiom` installed. `lib/logger.ts` exports `createLogger(source)` — a unified logger that writes structured logs to Axiom and forwards errors/warnings to Sentry as breadcrumbs/exceptions. Wired across all high-value API routes: `api/listings/submit`, `api/admin/listings`, `api/admin/events`, `api/dealer/apply`, `api/alerts/match`, `api/notify-watchers`, `api/conversations`, `api/conversations/[id]/messages`, `api/email/digest`, `api/email/dealer-report`, `api/email/expiring-listings` (`api/inquire` was in this list until it was deleted 2026-07-14). Env vars: `AXIOM_TOKEN`, `AXIOM_DATASET=garagecherries`. |
| Sell form — contact section removed | **Complete (2026-07-06)** | Seller name, phone, and email fields removed from `SellClient.tsx`. The submit API now reads `seller_name`/`seller_phone` from the `profiles` table and `seller_email` from the auth session. |
| Homepage hero stats | **Updated 2026-07-13** | Replaced placeholder stats ("12,400+ listings · All 50 states") with honest copy: "Growing daily · Worldwide · Classic, Muscle, Sport & Supercar" (2026-07-06; "Nationwide" changed to "Worldwide" sitewide 2026-07-13). Hero subtext also reworded 2026-07-13 to drop an unearned "thousands of listings" claim and USA-only framing. |
| Dedicated watchlist page (`/account/watchlist`) | **Complete** | Standalone URL for watchlist; price-change indicators; mirrors `/account?tab=watchlist` |
| Import JSON / Sync Now buttons | **Missing** | UI buttons exist in dealer dashboard but click handlers are stubs — no API route or format defined; sample format saved at `docs/dealer-import-sample.json` |
| Export inventory | **Complete** | GET /api/dealer/export?format=csv\|json; dashboard has "Export CSV" and "Export JSON" buttons |
| Admin email tool (`/admin/email`) | **Complete** | Manual trigger panel for digest, price-drop, and dealer-report batch emails; requires `ADMIN_API_SECRET`; not linked from `/admin` nav |
| Payment / billing for dealer plans | **Missing** | No Stripe or payment routes; billing deferred to post-beta |
| Seller/buyer ratings | **Missing** | No rating system for buyers/sellers (only dealer reviews) |
| Search full-text | **Complete** | Basic keyword search via `q` param: `SearchFilters.tsx` adds a Search input at the top of the filter panel; `app/listings/page.tsx` applies `ilike` on `title` and `description` columns server-side. Enter key or Apply Filters submits. AI/tsvector full-text search deferred. |

## 9. Gap List

### API routes with no UI calling them

| Route | Notes |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/email/price-drops` | Intended as a cron job; no UI trigger |
| `POST /api/email/digest` | Intended as a cron job; no UI trigger |
| `POST /api/email/dealer-report` | Intended as a cron job; no UI trigger |
| `POST /api/admin/cleanup-images` | Triggered from "Cleanup Orphan Images" card in the Team tab (superadmin only); shows deleted count inline |
| `GET /api/makes` | Used in server components / sitemap; no explicit UI call visible — appears used by `sitemap.ts` |

### UI pages with no complete API backing

| Page | Issue |
|---|---|
| `/admin/email` | **Complete** — manual trigger panel for the three batch email jobs (Weekly Digest, Price Drops, Monthly Dealer Report). Requires `ADMIN_API_SECRET` entered on the page. Not linked from `/admin` — must know the URL. No admin session check on the page itself (secret still required to trigger anything). |
| `dealer/dashboard` — "Import JSON" button | No API route for bulk inventory import; format not yet defined |
| `dealer/dashboard` — "Sync now" button | No API route for inventory sync |
| ~~`dealer/dashboard` — "Export" button~~ | **Fixed (P1)** — `GET /api/dealer/export?format=csv\|json` implemented; buttons wired |
| `/account/watchlist` | **Complete** — dedicated watchlist page; shows saved listings with price-change indicators (green = dropped, orange = increased since saved); redirects to login if unauthenticated; duplicates the Watchlist tab at `/account?tab=watchlist` but at a cleaner standalone URL |
| `/reports` | **Complete** — public market report page; pulls live data from listings table; shows active count, median/average price, sold this month, average price by make (bar chart), inventory by condition breakdown, most-viewed listings, static market commentary; good SEO content page; not linked from main nav |

### Business rules with no enforcement or test coverage

| Rule | Gap |
|---|---|
| Dealer beta expiry | ~~Only enforced on listing submit~~ **Fixed (P5)** — now enforced on listing submit AND listing edit (`PATCH /api/listings/[id]`). Dashboard login, metrics, and settings still not blocked. |
| Advertiser trial expiry | ~~Only enforced on ad CREATE~~ **Fixed (P6)** — trial check now applies to both create and edit in `POST /api/advertiser/ads`. |
| ~~One review per user per dealer~~ | **Fixed (2026-07-02)** — `UNIQUE(dealer_id, reviewer_id)` constraint added to `dealer_reviews`; app-level check-then-insert now backed by a DB constraint, with the resulting `23505` unique-violation mapped to the same friendly 409 response |
| ~~Max 10 alerts~~ | **Fixed (2026-07-02)** — `count` query kept for a fast friendly error, but the cap is now also enforced atomically by a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger on `saved_searches` using `pg_advisory_xact_lock`, closing the race (`supabase/migrations/20260702_race_condition_fixes.sql`) |
| ~~Max 10 listings (private seller)~~ | **Fixed (2026-07-02)** — insert now goes through `insert_listing_with_limit()` RPC, which atomically re-checks the count (advisory-lock-guarded) and inserts in one DB call; app still resolves the dealer/BETA_MODE exemption before calling it |
| Image URL host validation | Simple string contains check — does not verify URL is a Supabase Storage URL for this project's bucket by subdomain |

### Validations that are missing but should exist

| Missing Validation | Location | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| ~~`state` field not validated against STATES enum in API~~ | `POST /api/listings/submit`, `POST /api/dealer/apply` | **Fixed (M8)** — validated against `US_STATES` in `lib/constants.ts` |
| ~~`condition` field not validated against CONDITIONS enum~~ | `POST /api/listings/submit` | **Fixed (2026-07-03)** — validated against `CONDITIONS` from `lib/types` (excluding 'All'); invalid values return 400 |
| ~~`email` format not validated server-side~~ | `POST /api/inquire`, `POST /api/offers` | **Fixed (2026-07-03)** — regex check `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/` applied before any DB writes; invalid addresses return 400 |
| `price` clamped to ≥ 0 only on client | `POST /api/listings/submit` | `Number() \|\| 0` means price=0 accepted silently if non-numeric passed |
| `rating` validated 1–5 only in `POST /api/reviews` | Reviews API | Correct; only this route does it |
| `amount > 0` in `POST /api/offers` | Offers API | Validated; correct |
| `resubmission_note` only required client-side for rejections | `PATCH /api/listings/[id]` | API enforces it server-side (line 39); correct |
| No CAPTCHA on `POST /api/offers` | Offers API | Anonymous offer spam possible |
| No auth required on `POST /api/offers` | Offers API | Allows anonymous offers; intentional but enables spam |
| `phone` format not server-validated | Listings, dealer apply, offers | Any string accepted |
| ~~No rate limit on `POST /api/cars/verify-vin`~~ | VIN API | **Fixed (S6)** — 20/hr/IP |
| ~~No rate limit on `POST /api/offers`~~ | Offers API | **Fixed (S6)** — 10/hr/IP |
| ~~No rate limit on `POST /api/watchlist`~~ | Watchlist API | **Fixed (M1)** — 60/hr/IP |
| ~~No rate limit on `POST /api/conversations/[id]/messages`~~ | Messages API | **Fixed (M2)** — 60/hr/IP |
| ~~No rate limit on `POST /api/reviews`~~ | Reviews API | **Fixed (2026-07-02)** — 10/hr/IP |

### Notable Security Concerns

**Fixed (2026-07-02 — S1–S6):**

1. ~~`POST /api/alerts/match` had no auth~~ → **Fixed (S1)**: now requires `Bearer INTERNAL_API_SECRET`; only `PATCH /api/admin/listings` (approve action) passes the secret.
2. ~~`POST /api/notify-watchers` had no auth~~ → **Fixed (S2)**: now requires auth + seller ownership + 30/hr/IP rate limit.
3. ~~`POST /api/ads/track` had no rate limit~~ → **Fixed (S3)**: now rate limited to 60 clicks/hr/IP.
4. ~~Suspended users could still submit and edit listings~~ → **Fixed (S4)**: `POST /api/listings/submit` and `PATCH /api/listings/[id]` both check `suspended_users` table and return 403.
5. ~~`GET /api/dealer/watcher-counts` allowed any auth user to query watcher counts for any carIds~~ → **Fixed (S5)**: carIds now filtered to `seller_id = user.id` before querying watchlists.
6. ~~`POST /api/offers` and `POST /api/cars/verify-vin` had no rate limits~~ → **Fixed (S6)**: offers limited to 10/hr/IP; VIN lookups limited to 20/hr/IP.

**Remaining concerns:**

7. **Admin role scoping (support) in UI** — Fixed in `app/admin/page.tsx`: support role now lands on Reported tab, Listings/Messages/Users tabs are hidden. API-layer role checks (moderator+) were already correct. ✓ Resolved.
8. **`POST /api/ads/track`** — any caller can still log clicks for any `adId`; no ad ownership verified. Low risk (no data leak, only inflates counts), but could skew analytics.
9. ~~**`POST /api/admin/team` role allowlist**~~ — **Fixed (2026-07-03)**: API now accepts all 4 roles (`support`, `moderator`, `admin`, `superadmin`).
10. **No CAPTCHA on `POST /api/offers`** — anonymous offer submission is intentional (lowers friction for buyers) but enables spam. Rate limit (10/hr/IP) added in S6 as mitigation; CAPTCHA would be a stronger guard.

**Fixed in P2/P5/P6/P1 (2026-07-02):**
- ~~VIN verification not wired to sell form~~ → **Fixed (P2)** — VIN input + inline verify button on `/sell`; result badge shown; `vin`/`vin_verified` stored on submit
- ~~Dealer beta expiry not checked on listing edit~~ → **Fixed (P5)** — `PATCH /api/listings/[id]` now checks `beta_expires_at`
- ~~Advertiser trial not checked on ad edit~~ → **Fixed (P6)** — trial check now runs for both create and update in `POST /api/advertiser/ads`
- ~~Export inventory button was a stub~~ → **Fixed (P1-partial)** — `GET /api/dealer/export?format=csv|json` implemented and wired to dashboard

**Fixed in M1–M10 (2026-07-02):**
- ~~`POST /api/watchlist` had no rate limit~~ → **Fixed (M1)** — 60/hr/IP
- ~~`POST /api/conversations/[id]/messages` had no rate limit~~ → **Fixed (M2)** — 60/hr/IP
- ~~Ad `cta_url` accepted any scheme including `javascript:`~~ → **Fixed (M5)** — must be `http(s)://`
- ~~`state` field accepted any 2-char string~~ → **Fixed (M8)** — validated against `US_STATES` in `lib/constants.ts`
- ~~Ad serving ignored `radius_miles`~~ → **Fixed (M4)** — haversine distance against state centroids
- ~~`price_history` table had no RLS~~ → **Fixed (M10)** — RLS enabled; sellers read own only

**Fixed post-audit (2026-07-02):**
- ~~`dealer_reviews` had no unique constraint~~ → **Fixed** — `UNIQUE(dealer_id, reviewer_id)` added via `supabase/migrations/20260702_dealer_reviews_unique.sql`; closes the check-then-insert race in `POST /api/reviews`
- ~~`POST /api/reviews` had no rate limit~~ → **Fixed** — 10/hr/IP via `lib/rateLimit.ts`
- ~~Max 10 alerts race condition~~ → **Fixed** — `BEFORE INSERT` trigger on `saved_searches` (advisory-lock-guarded) via `supabase/migrations/20260702_race_condition_fixes.sql`
- ~~Max 10 listings race condition~~ → **Fixed** — `POST /api/listings/submit` now inserts via `insert_listing_with_limit()` RPC, which atomically re-checks the count under an advisory lock before inserting
